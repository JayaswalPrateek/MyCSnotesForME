	- depth first search for trees and graphs
		- start from the top of a tree and go as deep as possible along the same branch

			- this process is called backtracking
		- used to solve a maze
		- O(number of nodes+number of branches)

	- breadth first search for trees and graphs
		- you dont go to deepest point like dfs
		- instead you make sure that the sibling
