 * bfs is visiting all nodes at a level(top to bottom) from left to right
 * dfs if we area at a child then we completely visit the entire subtree of that child
 *      3 ways
 *      preorder    root->left subtree->right subtree short form data left right dlr
 *      inorder     left subtree->root->right subtree short form left data right dlr
 *      postorder   left subtree->right subtree->root short form left right data dlr
 *      data means read or access the data before moving to the next subtree
