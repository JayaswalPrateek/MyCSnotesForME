***Big O***
- O(1) are the most efficient algorithms as they scale really well because the execution time is independent of the input size
	- like searching a value in map using its key.
- O(n) means the execution time is linearly dependent on the input size
	- searching for an element in an array
	- we usually take the worst case scenario like if the element we are looking for is at the end of the array for an array of length n then its
